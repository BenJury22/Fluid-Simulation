# Fluid Particle Simulation

## Set Up Environment
This project uses conda to manage python packages. With conda installed, create the environment using the command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Then activate the environment using the command:
```
conda activate fluid-particle-env
```

## Run Code
Running the python file "main.py" runs the simulation and animation.
